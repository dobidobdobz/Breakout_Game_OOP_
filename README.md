Breakout game! 

The classic breakout game, from the good old atari days! 

Ive recreated this game in turtle, pygame Libraries written in python, with Object orientented programming in mind! 
I've added 3 lifes (attempts), sound effects for collision detection, failure to hit ball with paddle, and many more.
For every block hit with the block the speed will increase!
Did i mention there is back ground music too?
bellow is some gif's of the game in action!
